The task is to create a basic TODO app with a custom State Management System that the app must use.

The TODO app must have the following functionality - 

1.  List of all open TODO tasks.
2.  Add a TODO task.
3.  Mark an open TODO task as completed.
4.  Mark a completed TODO task as not done (or open), which essentially brings it back to the open tasks in the list.
5.  Delete a task.
6.  Refreshing the page resets the list to an empty state.
7.  The app need not be responsive and can have just the bare minimum styling so that it looks presentable.

The State Management System should have the following abilties/functionalities - 

1.  Get the current state.
2.  Perform mutations to the existing data.
3.  Ensure that the original data immutable for consistency.
4.  A mechanism for communicating between the system and components attached to it.

The folder structure is just as a reference, please feel free to create/remove them and add new files or folders as needed.
